I am looking for strongly motivated students and postdocs to work on problems at the interface of geophysical fluid dynamics, applied mathematics, and high resolution numerical simulations. Look at the publications page to get an idea of the kind of research I'm involved in. If you are looking for a job, write to me with your detailed academic CV. I am at present looking for:

1) **Postdoctoral fellow:** should have a PhD (or close to submitting thesis) with substantial computational experience in HPC environment.

2) **PhD students:** students enrolled at ICTS-TIFR or TIFR-CAM are welcome. 
 
3) **Undergraduate students:** must be close to completing their degree, should have reasonable understanding of fluid mechanics, and must have interest in computational work.

<!-- ## Reanalysis data
[**ERA5**](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview) is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. 

## Models
[**The System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM)**](http://rossby.msrc.sunysb.edu/~marat/SAM.html) is a very cute cloud-resolving model. It's useful for conducting idealized cloud-resolving simulaltions for a theoretical purpose. -->
